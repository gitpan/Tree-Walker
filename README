Tree-Walker

Tree::Walker provides a convenient framework for walking the filesystem,
and is written for ease of subclassing for other hierarchical things,
like FTP servers or XML trees.

It also provides a couple of useful syntactic sugar items for quick file walkers
in just a couple of lines.
